# TF-IDF from Scratch with Text Generation
This repository provides implementations of the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm from scratch in two different ways, along with text generation methods. <br />
TF-IDF is a fundamental technique in natural language processing for assessing the importance of terms within documents relative to a corpus.  <br />
The project aims to offer a resource for understanding TF-IDF through hands-on implementation and exploring its applications in text generation.  <br />
